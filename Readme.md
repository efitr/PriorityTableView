# This is the implementation of a PriorityQueue working with a TableView.

## Objective:
* The table view rows will go up depending on their level of priority, in which the closer the date is due, the higher up it will move.

### Acknowledgements:
* The code provided for the implementations of the priorityQueue were made by JimmyMAndersson, he did not provide the code with previous knowledge and I stumble upon it through his medium article that I encorage you to read, also check his github account and star the project.
